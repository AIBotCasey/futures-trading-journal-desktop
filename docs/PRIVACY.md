# Privacy

FTJournal is designed to be **local-first**.

## What we do
- Store your trades and journal entries in a local database on your machine.
- Provide optional database encryption ("Secure mode").

## What we do NOT do
- No sign-in.
- No cloud sync.
- No analytics/telemetry by default.
- No uploading your trades/journal data anywhere.

## Network access
FTJournal does not need network access to function.

Future integrations (if ever added) must be **explicitly enabled** by the user and should be gated behind clear UI + documentation.
